## Professional Self-Assessment
At the start of August of 2023, I started the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). When I joined the Computer Science program, I already had a majority of college requirements completed. I originally start back in Fall of 2017 at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) as part of the Computer Engineering program where I would get my first experience with programming. During my time at RIT, I grew fond of Computer Science and then the COVID-19 pandemic hit which forced me to seek a change in career path. In Fall of 2023 I was able to restart my career path at SNHU through the Computer Science program.

When I joined SNHU I planned to follow my growing desire to be a Software Developer. I wanted to turn my failure to complete RIT into a success at SNHU. I wanted to take my skills from RIT and my lack of time after the pandemic into something positive. As a result, I joined the program to further drive my skills in a positive manor and to improve my programming and development of applications.

During my time in the Computer Science program, I learned and improved vastly in my abilities, skills, and knowledge. To succeed I improved my attention to details, security practices, and writing into crucial skills in order to perform as both a Software Developer and Software Engineer. As part of this I learned the importance of being organized and cautious when developing code. Focusing on creating simple code blocks and testing them as part of a workflow allows me to improve my skills and abilities. The importance of organization helps to promote a well structure coding environment and promotes clean coding practice with good documentation. Testing is crucial to ensure that program functions as expected and is free of bugs, vulnerabilities, and oversites as the project expands. By adopting these mindsets, I can continue to grow my abilities continuously. 

Focusing on attention to detail is important as it directly relates to code reviews, security standards, and computer science best practices. It is important to look at programming critically while also insuring that through the process you keep security in mind. These ideas help to keep a program improving while also building a zero-trust ethic and allow me to continue improving my coding skills. By combining my critical thinking in code reviews with security focused mindset, I am able to effectively analyze both my own code and peers code to mitigate the mistakes and vulnerabilities that are missing during development. Combining these with best practices and standards helps to ensure that the format is understood and easily maintainable in the future. Additionally, it makes it easier to think critically for both me and my peers during reviews. Through this process it also makes it easier to ask for assistance from peers, allowing them to easily review my work, which is another way for me to continue to improve my abilities and skills. Likewise, it helps me to keep looking at my work with fresh eyes and will help find the oversites, mistakes, and flaws within my code.

Throughout my time pre and post COVID-19 I learned the importance of the Software Development Lifecycle and how to use it to apply management strategies to work on large-scale projects as both an individual and as part of a team. In order to keep a large project moving it is important to plan and communicate with both peers and team members as well as the customer. This allows everyone to understand the requirements and expectations of the project based on the clientâ€™s needs. Understanding the needs of the client as part of SDLC helps translate the need functionality of the product into algorithms and pseudocode. Additionally, it helps to form a concise design through creation of flowcharts, documentations, and requirements. The use of this knowledge helps to keep the flow of the development cycle as well as to provide the client with satisfaction when put into practice. All of these skills mentioned above along with creativity, communication and time management have been improved over my time with development for both personal and professional work.

| **Hard Skills** | **Soft Skills** |

Through the computer science program, I was able to improve my leaning of new skills in just under two years. I was able to bring new solutions to problems with a leadership focused attitude and intellectual modesty in order to be successful in computer science. I was able to excel in computer science by using both my soft and hard skills such as Computer and Technology Skills, Computer Hardware Skills, Data Analysis, Software Development, Technical Writing, and Critical Thinking. Through this portfolio and accompanying artifacts each one of these skills are demonstrated, improved upon, and exemplified. Together both my soft and hard skills form the foundation of my computer science career and give me the ability to excel as a software engineer and developer in a way that anyone can understand.

### Other Courses
Every course throughout the program has in some manor impacted and helped me to gain the information, abilities, and skills needed to be successful in my career path as a Computer Science major. While my knowledge is not limited to these courses nor are they the focus of this portfolio, it is important to address them as they have made an impact on me and shaped my career path. From these courses I have learned key fundamentals in my programming knowledge, displayed skills and abilities, and grew throughout the computer science program.

Both IT 140 Introduction to Scripting and IT 145 Foundation in Application Development, survived as a perfect reintroduction to coding following the pandemic. While I had similar class as part of the Computer Engineering program at RIT these classes allowed me to expand and relearn key fundamentals in coding. They allowed me to express my knowledge while reinforcing that knowledge through practice. This knowledge and process renewed my determination and focus on computer science, giving me the drive to succeed after failing before.

CS 300 Data Structures and Algorithms: Analysis and Design was my first real step into C++ and taught me valuable information about the importance of data structures and the algorithms used during the course. It taught me the importance of speed when choosing data structures and their associated algorithms such as sorting or accessing information. Likewise, it gave me confidence in CS 330 Computer Graphics and Visualization which was another C++ course. The confidence gained from my experience in CS 300 and programing in C++ drove me to create complex scenes in CS 330. This complex scene forced me to use the skills learned from other courses to break down large function call into blocks and render each block independent of each other.

CS 320 Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance taught me the importance of testing my code through the use of Junit. It revealed just how important the aspects of testing are and why coverage testing is both important but not all inclusive. With this course it was not about demonstrating my skills or abilities to program it was about testing them and showing the importance of that testing.

Finally, CS 360 Mobile Architecture and Programming and CS 340 Client/Server Development, which are my two chosen artifacts, represent my choices for enhancement. In CS 360, I was able to take my skills and ability into a mobile environment to create an event planner for android. This tested my skills to develop and create software on any platform. For CS 340, it tests my ability to interact and display database information on a webpage. These database skills and ability are important to how to store data and access data correctly. 

Both these artifacts were chosen as they represent a key area of growth in Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structure, and Databases. Through these artifacts I was able to demonstrate enhancements based on what was learned throughout the program. I believe that both show an accurate representation of my learning and display my skills and abilities in computer science.

### Preparing For The Future
In order to prepare for the future, the Computer Science program has helped to grow me into a professional by preparing me to build a fulfilling and productive career in computer science. As I finish my long journey it is important to reflect and draw on my motivations. In order to do so I have created this ePortfolio to help me join the computer science professionals which is a significant achievement that a few years ago was just a fading dream.

As a result, this ePortfolio demonstrates my abilities to use well-founded and innovative techniques. It demonstrates my implementations of computer science solutions which deliver value and accomplish industry specific goals. Through both CS 340â€™s databases and CS 360â€™s mobile development I demonstrate the importance of reaching goals and providing value to application that were limited. From completing the goal of a daily planner missing from submission, to expanding the scope of the MongoDB database to new platforms I was able to show my well-founded and innovative techniques.

In order to design and evaluate computer solutions that solve problems using algorithmic principles and computer science practices that are appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices through engineering considerations, I designed and created a daily planner with a view generation algorithm while making trade-offs in its design to make the daily planner functional. These algorithms limited the number of events to be displayed simultaneously thus both the design, and the algorithm had to be designed around this limitation.

In all of my artifacts as well as my other project I demonstrate the importance of a security mindset during development process. In CS 340 the main focus of its enhancement was focusing on the installation process of MongoDB and database setup. As a result, security of the accounts accessing the database was the forefront of the installation process. During CS 360, access to the database via SQL query was restricted to functions which in the program which intern limited access to the database based on the logged in user. Both these are focused on insuring the importance of security by limiting potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources.

As the future unfolds, I am looking forward to being able to learn and grow. Each one of my projects drives me to complete my work even when faced with difficulties. Mobile development is brand new to me and yet I strived to deliver a difficult improvement. I am looking forward to improving this knowledge and so much more from senior experience, coworkers and great mentors. I strive to participate in a collaborative environment that will facilitate exciting fresh solutions that will help clients and team members deliver product visions with the highest outcome. As a dependable and diligent professional with a great sense of eagerness, organization, and exception desire to learn and advance my skills, I look forward to entering into this new stage of technologies and always improving skillsets.

    <p><em>Code Review Video</em></p>
</div>

As a software developer, code reviews are critical aspects of software development. Code reviews help to ensure quality assurance for our products. Often this review will find critical bugs, oversites, and mistakes within our code before they become issues later on. Code reviews can sometime be thought of as a wastes of times and adds unnecessary burden to the development cycle or are to small to be worth the effort. In either instance we are mistaken.

Code Reviews are a systematic approach that examines the sources code. This process may also be called peer review. The goal of this type of review is to remove bugs, oversites, coding mistakes, and left over code. Traditionally, it helps to eliminate the issues during the initial development phase allowing for the core functional of the product to have a high quality. Reviewing code is important as it helps to advance development skills, and they act as an assurance of quality.
Code reviews allow for catching errors, enhancing the teamsâ€™ abilities, and improving fault tolerances in both organizations and individuals by making problems easier to recover from. Overall, it results in better code and better practices while making the end product more manageable. Likewise, a code review is a great opportunity to determine enhancements and improvements to the overall design.

Through a code review of my two chosen artifacts, I was able to better understand my projects while addressing flaws and addition to it from a clear state of mind. This helped me to refine those enhancements and to employ strategies to improve the critical elements of the existing code.

## Software Design and Engineering / Algorithms and Data Structures

As shown during the code review, this CS 360 artifact was selected for the Software Design and Engineering and the Algorithms and Data Structures categories. The mobile event planner applicationâ€™s goal was to be able to create and manage events using an android platform. The software was designed and developed as part of the CS 360 Mobile Architecture and Programming course. It uses a combination of JAVA and SQLite in order to provide functionality and store event data. The primary IDE used for this development was that of Android Studio as it contained an android emulator.

The provided artifact from CS 360 is an android application that was designed to be an Event Planner. As stated, this Event Planner was coded in Android Studio using Java as the coding language. The Event Planner had basic functionality in the form of being able to create, edit, and delete events as well as display, reminded, and store those events. In order to complete such a task, the program made use of two databases, one for users and one for events. These databases were then used to complete the as for mentioned tasks.

<div style="text-align: center;">

        <p><em>Figure 1 - Upcoming Events and Figure 2 - Calendar View</em></p>
</div>

The reason for choosing this artifact was to continue the original goal of the project. As a result, I want to continue the design and engineering of the application to bring the project to a better closure point. In order to continue the design and engineering of the application, I had to expand the use of the current data structure and design and algorithm to present that data structure in a good format for the end user. 

As part of the enhancement a new fragment was designed using both Software Design and Engineering, and Algorithms and Data Structures. The new fragment used a combination of designs and engineering of the user interface combined with a powerful algorithm that could generate those custom views in real time. Allowing for the product to finally reach its original goals.

    <p><em>Figure 3 - Daily Planner View</em></p>
</div>

I was able to through the creation of the daily planner portion of this artifact demonstrating my familiar skills of Java and stretch my knowledge mobile development. In order to complete the development of the daily planner fragment. This improvement not only greatly improves the functionality of the end product, but it also brings the application to a much better closure and feeling of completeness. 

The outcome I set out to achieve with this enhancement was to demonstrate my ability to use my techniques, skills, and tools to deliver value and accomplished industry-specific goals. This outcome was by far the most important to this, as stated I felt that the application did not reach those goals when it was submitted. Now I feel like it finally reached that goal, and it was done through the use of well-found and innovative techniques, skills, and tools. 

Similarly, during the process I design, develop, and deliver clear visual improvement to the daily planner which will allow it to be easily understood while being technically sound for different audiences or context. An example of this was making the format of the daily planner easy to read, it follows the current time zone no matter where you are, and it informs the user of overlapping events. 

Likewise, during the code review the product had many features that promote security in the application. These features from previous fragment were carried over to the new daily planner fragment. As a result, prevent an exploitation in the daily planner fragment.

Additionally, through the use of algorithmic principles and a trade off in design choices I was able to create an algorithm for the daily event viewer which restricted the design to two events show next to each other at the same time in order to keep the speed of the algorithm usable while also keeping the design visually appealing.

## Databases
As shown during the code review, this CS 340 artifact was selected for the database category. The Salvare Search for Rescue Web Application goal was to be able to use a CRUD module to display database entries in a web interface. The software was designed and developed as part of the CS 340 Client/Server Development course. It uses a combination of Python and Jupyter Notebook in order to provide functionality and display a webpage using Dash.

The provided artifact from CS 340 is a wen application that was designed to use a MongoDB python CRUD interface to read data from a database. In order to complete this task it used Jupyter Notebook with the Dash framework to create and render a webpage while using a python CRUD design to extract database data.

</div>

The primary reason for choosing this artifact for my ePortfolio was to convert the database from Linux to Windows. I figured it would be good practice converting software between the two as Jupyter supports both platforms and so does MongoDB. However, quickly I learned that this was far too simple, so I expanded the scope to not only converting the project to Windows but to also including the setup of MongoDB. The setup focuses on not only installing Windows but also on Linux and focus on security which was not a major focus of the original design. Allowing me to focus on skills such as Database Management, Database Design, web design, python, and Jupyter Notebook. In order to achieve these goals, I had to set up MongoDB from scratch, install the dependencies from scratch, and finally modify and adapt existing code to work with new environments. 

In order to solve the complex setup process as well as ensure that security was taken into consideration a new install.md was created with a focus on security as well as describing the installation process for both operating systems. As part of the enhancement of anytime security is at question it is highly encouraged to use the security practices provided in the install.md. Likewise, focusing on security the version of Dash was updated to the latest version to help reduce security vulnerabilities while also removing old dependencies.

</div>


The primary outcome I set out to achieve with this enhancement was to expand the functionality of this project to more diverse audiences via an expansion towards Windows from Linux. Windows is still a more dominant OS so opening up a CRUD based on Windows would help expand the scope of the project. 

However, as the enhancement got underway, I was the opportunity to expand this to include a security mindset that would prevent exploits from accessing the database or design of the project. Such examples include protecting the admin account of the database, limiting permissions of exposed users accounts, and addressing reasons for these concerns. For example, while an account with access to the database would work for the project because it is exposed via the CRUD module it is important to ensure that account only does what is needed of it.
