# Outcomes
The ultimate goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate my growth throughout my time at Southern New Hampshires University through the Computer Science program. In order to show these a series of outcomes for this portfolio were designed to highly key aspects of my growth. Below I have divided these into 5 outcomes that reflect how each aspect of this portfolio defines the specific outcome.

## Outcome 1
*Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science*

In order to achieve outcome 1, I focused on key aspects of the provide artifacts. One of these aspects was the feedback I received on my CS 360 Event Planner and on my CS 340 Database. The feedback from my CS 360 Event Planner was that of it being bugging and feeling incomplete and that was my main target for selecting as an artifact. Previously, I had fixed some of the bugs as I was not happy with how buggy it was but during its artifact enhancement, I focused on the second part of that feedback which was the feeling of incomplete. I kept looking back at the goal I set for the project back in the design stage and said feedback relating to the idea of a daily planner to be a great idea. That is what inspired me to put my mobile design skills to the test again to bring the feature to life. Other tools such as my code review helped to iron out the enhancements and focus on what was important to each of them. Another great example of this was my original submission for enhancements, the main area that was lacking was the CS 340 Database and it kept my mind open to expanding the scope which would be made.

## Outcome 2
*Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts*

Outcome 2 was completed primary by this portfolio itself as it was designed and developed to the standard of professional quality in the form of oral (code review), written (portfolio), and visual communication (code review, portfolio images). Likewise, these were created to be coherent, technically sound and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts. Each one of the artifacts provided as part of this portfolio demonstrates this in both how it is designed and how it is expressed. A good example of this is the user interface of both artifacts are designed to be straight forward and are tailored to diverse audiences and contexts. Another example is the pages designed specifically for each artifact for the audience to decide if they want a deeper dive.

## Outcome 3
*Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices*

To complete Outcome 3 I focused primarily on the daily planner part of the CS 360 artifact. In order for the daily planner to function a unique algorithm had to be developed by using computer science practices and standards related to its solution while managing its trade-off in design choices. To get the desired functionality of the daily planner I had to create a new algorithm that was able to access data structures such as a database, array list, and view containers. As part of this I had to make a trade off in the number of events to display as the more events the slower the algorithm and the more clutter the design. I determined that 2 event list was plenty and provided enough space to read the events.

## Outcome 4
*Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals*

I fulfilled Outcome 4 throughout my artifacts themselves, primarily that of the CS 360 artifact. My CS 360 artifact was specifically chosen as it lacked some of its industry specific goals upon its submission. One of these goals was that of the daily event planner which required much more effort than initially assumed, which was one of the reasons it was cut from submission. Through the CS 360 artifact I was able to leverage the view container of mobile applications to design a custom daily planner view. This project put many of my skills and tools in computer science to the test in order to not only design the layout of the planner but to also create the algorithm needs to allow the layout to function. In the end I was able to deliver on one of the goals of the application and add much needed value to the app that it was lacking when it was initially submitted.

## Outcome 5
*Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources*

Finally, outcome 5 this was one of the outcomes that I struggled to improve on as of my two artifacts both felt like they had security pretty well handled. That was until I noticed in my CS 340 artifact during the creation of user accounts in MongoDB that a security flaw was possible. In the project the webpage account used to view the data after porting to Windows was set up using an admin account. This admin account was hardcoded directly into the application and while ideally no one should see this data it could occur. This lead me to decide to create an install.md that highlights this potential security issue if their application is open to the public. Additionally in order to mitigate this risk warning where displayed in the install.md whenever possible choice could lead to a security flaw. Additionally, upon looking over both artifacts I found another security point that was patched in CS 360 and that was illegal access to other usersâ€™ data via a database query. In order to ensure that this does not happen two checks are made to ensure that the events pulled match the user that is logged in.

## Conclusion

By meeting all five outcomes, I have been able to through this portfolio and its artifact demonstrate my abilities to apply key computer science principles and practices in a way that are coherent and technically sound while being appropriately adapted to a specific technical audience and context.
